# Full Stack Open 2020

In 2020, during the first part of my maternity break, I completed the [Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about). 

A big thanks to  Matti Luukkainen and the Helsinki University for putting this together. I found it to be an invaluable learning resource to hone my coding skills and expand my understanding of frontend and backend technologies. Through 199 exercises and more than 100 hours of coding, I learned a ton about **React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, GraphQL, Typescript, MongoDB** and more. 

The curriculum was engaging and always very clear, so even while looking after my newborn baby girl, I didn't find it difficult to stay on track. Often I used every minute of her daily sleep time to continue with the material - coding while she was snoozing on my lap or while I was carrying her in the sling. Occassionally, I read to her some of the chapters as she was drifting off, so I wouldn't be surprised if her first words are React or Redux. 

I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone who'd like to brush up their frontend and/or backend skills.
