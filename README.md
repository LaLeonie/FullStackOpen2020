# Full Stack Open 2020

In 2020, during the first part of my maternity break, I completed the [Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about). 

A big thanks to  Matti Luukkainen and the Helsinki University for putting this together. I found it to be an invaluable learning resource to hone my coding skills and expand my understanding of frontend and backend technologies. Through 199 exercises and more than 100 hours of coding, I learned a ton about **React, Redux, NodeJs, Express, GraphQL, Typescript, MongoDB** and more. 

I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone who'd like to brush up their frontend and/or backend skills.
